A set of ROS/Gazebo packages that together simulate, in closed-loop, autonomous terrain data acquisition for training a semantic segmentation network towards terrain-adaptive autonomous off-road driving. See the demonstration videos and https://youtu.be/aOfmmZdM8kI.

ALgorithms:

Note: For proprietary reasons, I used openly available versions for this repository; although my implementation was in Python and C++, I retained the name of the methods to give the authors credit. This applies to the first two algorithms only.
